<h1>Policlínico Vásquez</h1>
<p>
    A website for a clinic I created from the ground-up using WordPress while living in Arequipa, Perú. 
    Completing this project was a unique challenge, as I had to create mockups, plan features, and build the site
    while communicating in Spanish with the client, all on a relatively short timetable.
