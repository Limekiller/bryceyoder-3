<h1>Gotcha!</h1>
<p>
    A webapp for facilitating real-life games of Assassinsâ€”where each participant is given a quarry to eliminate, and must do so before they are caught themselves.
    This project is quite old; the design patterns within it are less than ideal. Runs, for the most part, on straight PHP, although some cron scripts are written
    in Python.
