<h1>Goshen Historical Society</h1>
<p>
    I created a website design in WordPress for the Goshen Historical Society that brought a unique, memorable, and historical vibe to the website,
    perfect for grabbing a viewer's interest while maintaining a connection to the Society's roots. Unfortunately, the Society did not end up going with the 
    design. Luckily, it lives on here.
