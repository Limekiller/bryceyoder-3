<h1>Riverdance</h1>
<p>
    A music streaming application for the desktop. Python backend, Electron frontend using Eel. Fetches songs from YouTube and uses youtube-dl to
    download the files locally and then play. Uniquely, it allows users to input the credentials to their email address; once this has been done, song requests
    can be emailed to the account, and those requests will be added to the queue.
    My plan is to eventually integrate it with the following project (flamenco), and build one music playing/streaming/jukebox app for mobile devices.

    <li>Free and ad-free access to the entire YouTube Music library</li>
    <li>Jukebox mode allows listeners to submit song requests to the queue via email</li>

</ul>
