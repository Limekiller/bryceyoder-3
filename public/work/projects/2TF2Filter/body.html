<h1>TF2 Filter</h1>
<p>
    Use Google's Perspective API to filter hate speech in real-time from Team Fortress 2.
    I did a small research project in which I collected comments from TF2 matches, ranked each comment manually based on its toxicity,
    and ran each comment through Perspective to see at which threshhold the two ranking sets most closely matched; I then used this data to fine-tune
    the program. Will disable the in-built chat on startup, and uses PyQt to simply run a window on top of your TF2 game, ensuring that VAC
    doesn't think there's any cheating going on. Runs entirely in Python.

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Easy to run: add a few launch args to your game and open the program</li>
    <li>Outputs the in-game console to a log and monitors this file to determine gamestate</li>
    <li>Uses <i>graph-theory</i> to determine team affiliations 
    (all the log tells us is when someone enters a comment, and who kills who. But we can use this info to build a graph of team relationships)</li>
</ul>
