<h1>Radio Control</h1>
<p>
    Created for the Global Game Jam 2018, with theme <i>transmissions</i>. We combined the radio and car variety for a game where the car radio
    controls the steering, but only one station will give you directions. Rotate the mouse left or right to turn, and balance navigation with a continually changing
    radio to figure out where to go. Built in Unity with C#.
