<h1>Squirrelly: A GC Odyssey</h1>
<p>
    Developed as part of Goshen College's Maple Scholars program, 
    <i>Squirrelly</i> is a fun, fast-paced third-person collectathon where players collect as many nuts as possible without being run over!
    Built in Unity with C#, with Blender being used for modeling. The game was built as a way to test out the resources and materials that were being collected
    while creating the curriculum for a new Animation course and Game Development minor.
