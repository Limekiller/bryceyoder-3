Previously I was a devops engineer at Moodle, and before that I was lead developer at Bermudan Instacart-clone DropIt. I also do some freelance work on the side. I have a BA in Computer Science from Goshen College, and minored in graphic design there.</p><p>I love the problem-solving that comes with building software, and bringing art, design, and interface to life through code. If you want to work with me—to create a <span style='color: #0ac3ff'>new website</span>, update or finesse the design on an <span style='color: #cc58ba'>existing site</span>, or build a bespoke <span style='color: #f98012'>Moodle plugin</span>—feel free to contact me.</p><i>Some things I've worked with, both personally and professionally:</i>",
